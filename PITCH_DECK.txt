DIRECTOR PITCH DECK
================================================================================

TITLE: Director
TAGLINE: The AI agent team that lets a single founder run a $5M nonprofit with no back-office staff
SUBTAGLINE: Turning under-resourced founders into fundable, operationally tight organizations
ONE-LINER: Short term, we're a forward-deployed AI support team. Long term, we're building the autopilot that runs the entire nonprofit back office so a single founder can run a $5M org with almost no internal ops staff.

================================================================================
SLIDE 1: Problem – Founders Are the Whole Leadership Team
================================================================================

Nonprofit founders are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary.

They're expected to:
• Lead programs and vision
• Raise money (major gifts, grants, events)
• Run operations and finance
• Own communications and storytelling
• Manage staff, boards, and compliance

HIGHLIGHT: Promising orgs plateau at $300–600k or quietly shut down — not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone.

NOTE: When funding tightens and staff are cut, all of this collapses back onto one person. Right now, most of their time and money are trapped in back-office work that should be automated.

================================================================================
SLIDE 2: Ideal Customer – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)
================================================================================

Our initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.

These orgs:
• Have real donor and community relationships
• Have a history of 7-figure budgets or close

But in the current funding environment:
• They've laid off staff
• The founder is back to doing everything
• Many are considering shutting down despite strong demand

HIGHLIGHT: These leaders don't need another tool. They need a backbone.

NOTE: This hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches.

================================================================================
SLIDE 3: Ideal Customer – Foundations as Buyers
================================================================================

Foundations can sponsor multiple orgs at once.

The opportunity:
• Foundations already fund capacity-building for grantees
• They can purchase Director packages for 5–10 orgs
• One contract, multiple organizations transformed

Why this works:
• Foundations get measurable capacity ROI across portfolio
• Orgs get backbone support they couldn't afford alone
• Director gets predictable, larger contracts

HIGHLIGHT: A single foundation can unlock Director for an entire cohort of grantees.

================================================================================
SLIDE 4: Broken Options
================================================================================

Existing solutions don't fit this stage.

DIY SaaS stack:
CRMs, grant tools, accounting, email… Founders don't have time to integrate and maintain them.

Consultants & agencies:
Project-based, expensive, seen as "overhead." Advice without ongoing responsibility.

Rebuilding staff:
• ED: $100–150k
• Ops/Finance: ~$100k
• Development: ~$100k
• Comms/Program ops: $60–100k

HIGHLIGHT: There is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.

NOTE: $360–450k/year for the backbone on a fragile budget.

================================================================================
SLIDE 5: Director – What We Are
================================================================================

Director is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.

Director OS – a vertical operating system for:
• Revenue & relationships
• Runway & finance
• Ops & compliance
• Board & funder narratives

Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:
• Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)
• Finance/ops leadership
• Dedicated dev & ops roles as we scale
• Long term, Director becomes the autopilot for the nonprofit back office, not just a helper

HIGHLIGHT: We plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can't afford to rebuild alone.

CALLOUT: Short term, we're a forward-deployed AI support team. Long term, we're building the autopilot that runs the entire nonprofit back office so a single founder can run a $5M org with almost no internal ops staff.

================================================================================
SLIDE 6: Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First
================================================================================

Director is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.

Durable funding comes from:
• Major donors
• Anchor institutions
• Long-term partners

Grants are part of the picture, but:
• They are downstream of relationships
• "Open call" grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment

Director's focus:
• Map and grow the major gifts pipeline
• Prepare founders for high-stakes meetings
• Use grants strategically once relationships exist

HIGHLIGHT: Director is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.

================================================================================
SLIDE 7: The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp
================================================================================

Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.

Year 1 – Proto-Pod Team:
• Founder/CEO
• 1 Forward-Deployed Director
• 1 Finance Director
• 1 Founding Engineer

Phase 2 – 8 orgs:
Mature core agents handle repetitive tasks. Same structure supports more orgs.

Phase 3 – 16 orgs:
2+ FDDs. Standardized playbooks. Agents do recurring work.

Phase 4 – 100+ orgs:
• AI-native director team handles 90–95% of recurring work
• Pod becomes supervisory layer, not execution layer
• Single founder safely runs $3–5M org with no internal back-office hires

================================================================================
SLIDE 8: Director OS – Product Overview
================================================================================

One pane of glass for an org's backbone.

Revenue & Relationships:
Major gifts map, warm pipeline, next-best actions

Runway & Finance:
Live cash forecasts, budget vs actuals visibility

Ops & Compliance:
Recurring task engine, checklists, playbooks

Narratives & Reporting:
Board decks, funder reports, impact one-pagers

NOTE: Data flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs. Over time, Director OS becomes the autopilot layer that runs the nonprofit back office end-to-end.

================================================================================
SLIDE 9: AI Agents – From 2–4x Today to 90–95% Automation
================================================================================

On the path to automating 90–95% of nonprofit back-office work.

Major Gifts Agent:
• Scans email, calendar, CRM
• Maintains relationship maps
• Drafts donor emails & briefs

Finance & Runway Agent:
• Pulls accounting data
• Proposes categorizations
• Raises runway alerts

Ops & Compliance Agent:
• Runs recurring checklists
• Generates reminders
• Manages task lists

Board & Reporting Agent:
• Assembles board decks
• Creates funder reports
• Keeps board-ready view

HIGHLIGHT: Today: Agents draft, humans decide. Future: Agents execute end-to-end; humans supervise and handle exceptions.

================================================================================
SLIDE 10: Long-Term Vision – 10x the Backbone, 10x the Impact
================================================================================

From forward-deployed support team to fully autonomous nonprofit autopilot.

Today (v1 Director):
• Forward-deployed Director + Finance lead
• AI agents assist with finance, ops, comms, and donor prep
• One Pod supports 4–16 orgs

Future (Where We're Going):
• Fully AI-native director team for finance, ops, comms, development
• Agents handle 90–95% of recurring back-office work
• One Pod supervises 100+ orgs
• Founders and boards focus almost entirely on programs and relationships

HIGHLIGHT: Audacious goal: No nonprofit ever dies because of operations, fundraising, or compliance again — only because the mission is done.

================================================================================
SLIDE 11: Economics – Why This Makes Sense
================================================================================

Director makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.

Traditional backbone costs (small org):
• ED: $100–150k
• Ops/Finance: ~$100k
• Dev: ~$100k
• Comms/Program ops: $60–100k
• Total: $360–450k/year

With Director:
• ED/founder: $100–150k
• Director Pod: ~$80–120k/year
• Total backbone: $180–270k/year
• Long term, as a Pod supervises 100+ orgs, backbone costs can drop by ~80%, shifting dollars from administration back into programs

HIGHLIGHT: Save $100-180k/year in backbone costs

NOTE: As Pods scale, pod-level gross margins expand while keeping human leadership involvement high.

================================================================================
SLIDE 12: Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure
================================================================================

Two timing curves are intersecting.

Agentic AI is production-ready:
• "AI coworkers" already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer ops
• Small human teams can manage far more complexity with agents

Nonprofits are under structural pressure:
• Orgs with $1M+ budgets are losing staff
• Funders want grantees with credible backbones and visibility

The opportunity:
• For the first time, it's realistic to imagine automating 90–95% of nonprofit back-office work and letting a single founder safely run a $3–5M org with almost no internal ops staff

HIGHLIGHT: Director sits at this intersection: an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.

================================================================================
SLIDE 13: Go-to-Market
================================================================================

We start where we already have pull.

Existing relationships:
First 2–4 orgs from founders you're already effectively "directing."

Downshifted $1M orgs:
Target leaders who proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut staff.

Funder collaborations:
Position Director as capacity-building that makes grantees more investable.

Sales motion:
• Short diagnostic: map "today vs with Director"
• Demo Director OS + agents
• Show what gets taken off the founder's plate
• Close annual retainers
• Expand scope over time

================================================================================
SLIDE 14: Business Model & QSBS-Friendly Structure
================================================================================

AI-native vertical SaaS with embedded forward-deployed team.

Revenue model:
• Annual retainers per org
• Tied to budget band and complexity
• Goal: multiple Pods, each supporting up to 16 orgs
• At scale, Director can redirect billions of dollars of nonprofit overhead back into direct programs and community work

Cost structure:
• Lean Pods (FDD + Finance Director)
• Supported by agents and product
• Engineering compounds across all clients

QSBS-aware design:
• U.S. C-corp
• Product-centric operating business
• Software & data model assets

================================================================================
