# Add domain alias for workspaces (2025-12-11 03:25Z)

_**User (2025-12-09 10:50Z)**_

Help me add Bosko at the directorforgood.org. I want to add that new domain as an alias basically for my workspaces. How do I do that?

The user wants to add a new email alias "Bosko@directorforgood.org" to their Google Workspace. This is about Google Workspace admin configuration, not code.

Let me look at the project to understand the context better - this appears to be a website project for directorforgood.org.</details></think>

To add Bosko@directorforgood.org as an email alias in Google Workspace:

1. **Go to** [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com)
2. **Navigate to:** Directory → Users
3. **Click on** the user you want to add the alias to
4. **Click** "User information" (or the user's name to expand details)
5. **Find** "Alternate email addresses (email alias)" section
6. **Click** "Add Alternate Email"
7. **Enter:** `Bosko` (the domain should auto-populate as directorforgood.org)
8. **Save**

The alias will be active within a few minutes. Emails to Bosko@directorforgood.org will land in that user's inbox.

**If directorforgood.org isn't showing as a domain option**, you need to add it first:
1. Admin console → Account → Domains → Manage domains
2. Add directorforgood.org as a secondary domain or domain alias
3. Verify ownership via DNS TXT record
4. Then add the user alias

Want me to help with DNS verification records if needed?
