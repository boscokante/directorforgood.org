The user wants to deploy their hiiiwav-website to Vercel so they can get a live preview URL to share with collaborators. Based on the dev-studio-README.md, the workflow is:

1. Push repo to GitHub (already done - they have a GitHub repo)
2. Import to Vercel
3. Add environment variables
4. Get preview URLs

Let me check what this project currently uses for database/env setup to understand what environment variables might be needed.</details></think>

Let me check your current setup to see what env vars you need for deployment.

OK, so the key env vars needed are:
1. `DATABASE_URL` - Neon PostgreSQL connection string
2. `AUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth secret (NextAuth v5 requires this)
3. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI for AI features (used by @ai-sdk/openai)

The site is already on GitHub (`origin/main`). To deploy:

1. Go to Vercel and import the repo
2. Add the env vars
3. Deploy

Since the user is asking me to help them deploy, I should give them the steps. But I can't actually log into Vercel for them. Let me provide clear instructions.

Actually, let me check if there are Vercel-specific files already.</details></think>

---

Your project is already on GitHub. Here's how to deploy to Vercel for a shareable preview URL:

## Deploy to Vercel (5 min)

### 1. Import to Vercel
Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) → Import your `hiiiwav-website` repo

### 2. Add Environment Variables
In the Vercel project settings, add these env vars (copy values from your local `.env.local`):

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | Your Neon connection string |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | ✅ | NextAuth secret (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`) |
| `AUTH_URL` | ✅ | Set to your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://hiiiwav-website.vercel.app`) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional | Only if you want AI chat to work |

### 3. Deploy
Click "Deploy" - Vercel will build and give you a URL like:
- **Production**: `hiiiwav-website.vercel.app` (or custom domain)
- **Preview** (every branch/PR): `hiiiwav-website-abc123.vercel.app`

---

## Quick Commands

If you don't have `AUTH_SECRET` yet:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

---

## Sharing Preview URLs

Once deployed:
- Push to `main` → updates production
- Push to any branch → auto-generates a unique preview URL to share
- Each PR gets its own preview URL in the GitHub comments

Want me to help you check your `.env.local` to see which vars you have, or set up anything else for the deployment?

_**User (2025-12-04 17:54Z)**_

Do I have to create a new Vercel project? 

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking if they need to create a new Vercel project. Based on the dev-studio-README.md they attached, the idea is to use ONE Vercel account for multiple projects. But each project (repo) still gets imported as a separate Vercel project - they just all live under the same Vercel account/team for consolidated billing.

So yes, they need to import this repo as a new project in Vercel, but it'll be under their existing Vercel account.</details></think>

---

Yes, but it's just "Import" — not manual setup.

Per your dev-studio pattern: **one Vercel account, multiple projects**. Each repo becomes its own Vercel project under your account.

Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) → select `hiiiwav-website` repo → Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures everything. Add env vars → Deploy.

Takes ~2 minutes. No config files needed.

---

_**User (2025-12-04 17:54Z)**_

my NEXTAUTH_URL is  http://localhost:3000. but it doesn't seem right. 

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking about NEXTAUTH_URL (or AUTH_URL in NextAuth v5). They have it set to localhost:3000 which is correct for local development, but for Vercel deployment they need to change it.

In NextAuth v5 (which this project uses based on `next-auth": "^5.0.0-beta.30"`), the env var is `AUTH_URL` not `NEXTAUTH_URL`.

For Vercel:
- They need to set `AUTH_URL` to their Vercel URL
- Vercel also auto-sets `VERCEL_URL` which NextAuth can use

Actually, NextAuth v5 with the App Router is smart about this - it can auto-detect the URL in production. But it's still good practice to set it explicitly.</details></think>

---

Correct — `localhost:3000` is only for local dev.

For Vercel, you have two options:

**Option 1: Let Vercel handle it (recommended)**
Don't set `AUTH_URL` at all in Vercel. NextAuth v5 auto-detects the URL from Vercel's `VERCEL_URL` env var.

**Option 2: Set it explicitly**
After your first deploy, set:
```
AUTH_URL=https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```

---

**TL;DR**: Leave `AUTH_URL` out of Vercel env vars for now. Deploy first, then add it if auth breaks (it usually doesn't).

---

_**User (2025-12-04 17:54Z)**_

this is what I have. 

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is showing me their Vercel deployment setup screen. Looking at what they have:

1. DATABASE_URL - pointing to supabase pooler (looks good)
2. NEXTAUTH_SECRET - has a value (good)
3. OPENAI_API_KEY - has a value (good)

One thing I notice: they're using `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` but since they're on NextAuth v5 (beta 30), the env var should be `AUTH_SECRET` not `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. NextAuth v5 changed the naming convention.

Let me double-check this by looking at their auth.ts again... Actually, I already read it - they're using `NextAuth` from `next-auth` which is v5. In v5, the env var is `AUTH_SECRET`.

They should change `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to `AUTH_SECRET`.

Otherwise, looks good to deploy!</details></think>

---

Looks good! One fix:

**Change `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` → `AUTH_SECRET`**

You're on NextAuth v5 which renamed that env var. Everything else is correct.

Hit Deploy after that change.

---

_**User (2025-12-04 17:54Z)**_

Is everything right now? 

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Looking at the second screenshot, the user now has:
1. DATABASE_URL - pointing to supabase pooler ✓
2. AUTH_SECRET - has a value ✓
3. OPENAI_API_KEY - has a value ✓

This looks correct. They changed NEXTAUTH_SECRET to AUTH_SECRET.

I also see from the first screenshot their local .env.local still has NEXTAUTH_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_URL, but that's fine for local dev (NextAuth v5 still reads both for backwards compatibility). The Vercel config is what matters for deployment.

They're good to deploy!</details></think>

---

Yes, looks good. Hit Deploy.

You'll get your preview URL in ~2 minutes.

---

_**User (2025-12-04 18:36Z)**_

there are build errors

---

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Looking at the build errors, I can see:

1. `A Node.js module is loaded ('path' at line 2) which is not supported in the Edge Runtime`
2. The error is in `./db/index.ts`
3. It's also complaining about `process.cwd()` being used in Edge Runtime

The issue is that `db/index.ts` uses:
- `resolve` from 'path' 
- `config` from 'dotenv'
- `process.cwd()`

These are Node.js APIs not available in Edge Runtime. The problem is likely that some API route or middleware that uses the database is running in Edge Runtime.

Looking at the build logs:
- `./db/index.ts:2:1` - import path issue
- `./db/index.ts:6:26` - process.cwd() issue

The db/index.ts file has this code that's problematic for Edge:
```ts
import { config } from 'dotenv'
import { resolve } from 'path'

// Load .env.local file if not already loaded
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  config({ path: resolve(process.cwd(), '.env.local') })
}
```

This dotenv loading logic is only needed for local scripts, not for the actual Next.js app (which loads env vars automatically). The issue is this code runs when the db module is imported, even in Edge runtime.

The fix is to remove the dotenv loading from db/index.ts since Next.js handles env vars automatically in production.</details></think>

---

The issue is `db/index.ts` uses Node.js-only APIs (`path`, `dotenv`, `process.cwd()`) that don't work in Edge Runtime.

The dotenv loading is only needed for local scripts — Next.js automatically loads env vars in production. Let me fix it:

The scripts already have their own dotenv loading at the top, so they'll work fine. The db/index.ts no longer needs it because:
1. In Next.js app: env vars are loaded automatically
2. In scripts: they load dotenv before importing db

Now I need to commit this change and push to trigger a new deployment. Let me also check for any linting errors first.</details></think>

Good — the scripts already load dotenv themselves before importing `db`. Now commit and push to trigger a new deploy:

The error is clear: `DATABASE_URL is not set`. This means the env var isn't being passed to the build process.

Looking at Vercel's behavior:
- Env vars set in the Vercel dashboard are available at **runtime** 
- But for **build time**, you need to make sure the env vars are also available during build

The issue is that the DATABASE_URL needs to be available during the build because:
1. Next.js is trying to pre-render pages that use the database
2. The `db` module is being initialized at module load time (top-level)

Two solutions:

1. **Make sure env vars are available during build** - In Vercel, env vars are available during build by default if added in the dashboard. But the user might have only added them for "Production" environment, not "Preview" or during "Build".

2. **Lazy-load the database connection** - Don't initialize the db at module load time

Let me check if the user's env vars in Vercel are set for all environments (Production, Preview, Development) and also for the Build step.

Actually, looking at their earlier screenshot, they added the env vars. But it's possible they need to make sure "Available to Build" is enabled.

Wait, by default Vercel makes env vars available to the build. Let me check if there's something else going on.

Actually, the more likely issue is that the project name changed - in the second screenshot it shows `hiiiwav-website-5fqd` not `hiiiwav-website`. This might mean they created a new project import and the env vars weren't carried over.

Let me suggest they check:
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Make sure DATABASE_URL is there
3. Make sure it's enabled for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

Or they could just redeploy with the env vars properly set.</details></think>

---

The env vars aren't reaching the build. Go to your Vercel project:

**Settings → Environment Variables** 

Check that `DATABASE_URL` is there and enabled for **all environments** (Production, Preview, Development) — not just Production.

If missing, re-add it. Then click **Deployments → ⋮ → Redeploy** on the failed deployment.

---

Alternatively, the project name shows `hiiiwav-website-5fqd` — if you created a second project import, the env vars from the first one won't carry over. Make sure you're looking at the right project.

https://hiiiwav-website.vercel.app/  the site is already up and running. Perhaps I created a duplicate by mistake. How can we check that this repo is connected to this website?

The user is saying the site is already live at https://hiiiwav-website.vercel.app/ but they might have created a duplicate project. Let me help them verify which GitHub repo is connected to the existing deployed site.

They should check in Vercel dashboard which repo is connected to the working project.</details></think>

---

The site is live! To verify the connection:

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on **hiiiwav-website** (the working one)
3. Look at **Settings → Git** — it will show which GitHub repo is connected

If it shows `boscokante/hiiiwav-website`, you're good. Delete the duplicate project (`hiiiwav-website-5fqd`).

Or quicker — push a small change and see if the live site updates:

The latest commit is the fix I made. Let me check if the live site has this fix or the previous version. Actually, the site is already working, so it's possible the existing deployment was from before my changes and it worked because it had env vars set properly.

Let me help the user verify by suggesting they check the Vercel dashboard.</details></think>

---

Your latest commit is `a598856`. Check in Vercel → **hiiiwav-website** → **Deployments** — if the most recent successful deployment shows that commit hash, your repo is connected.

If it shows an older commit, the working site might be from a different repo or the connection broke. Just delete the duplicate `hiiiwav-website-5fqd` project and stick with the working one.

The user deleted the duplicate project. Now they should be good with the original working project at hiiiwav-website.vercel.app. Let me confirm the site is working and they can share the URL with collaborators.</details></think>

---

You're all set. Your live site is:

**https://hiiiwav-website.vercel.app/**

Share that URL with collaborators. Any push to `main` will auto-deploy. For branch previews, push to a new branch and Vercel will generate a unique preview URL.

The user wants to use a video file as the hero background on the homepage. Let me first check the current homepage structure and then update it to use this video.

The video is at `/Users/boskombp16/GitHub/hiiiwav-website/media/HiiIWAV Highlights SIte V1.mp4`

I need to:
1. Move/copy the video to the public folder so it can be served
2. Update the homepage to use the video as a full-width hero background

Let me first look at the current homepage structure.</details></think>

60MB is a bit large for a hero video. It will work but might cause slow loading. I should let the user know. Let me push the changes and let them test it. If needed, they can compress the video later.

Actually, 60MB might be too large for GitHub (100MB limit per file) and definitely not ideal for web. But it's under the limit, so let's push it.</details></think>

60MB is large but under GitHub's 100MB limit. Pushing now — you may want to compress this later for faster loading:

Done. The push succeeded with a warning about the large file. Vercel should auto-deploy now. Let me let the user know.</details></think>

---

Done. Vercel will auto-deploy. Check https://hiiiwav-website.vercel.app/ in a minute.

**Note:** GitHub flagged the 60MB video. For better performance, consider compressing it later:

```bash
ffmpeg -i hiiiwav-highlights.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast -an hero-compressed.mp4
```

This can cut it to ~15-20MB without noticeable quality loss for a background video.
