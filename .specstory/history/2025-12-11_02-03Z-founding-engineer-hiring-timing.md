# Founding engineer hiring timing (2025-12-11 02:03Z)

_**User (2025-12-09 10:50Z)**_

I think founding engineer is either hire number one or hire number two. Give me your opinion on this.

The user is asking me a general question about what constitutes a "founding engineer" - specifically whether it's hire #1 or #2. This isn't a coding question about their codebase, it's more of a career/startup terminology question.

Let me give them my opinion on this.</details></think>

---

Founding engineer is typically hire #1-3 on the engineering side, but the title is more about *role and equity* than sequence.

**My take:** It's not strictly about the number. A founding engineer:

1. **Joins pre-product or very early** (usually <10 employees, often <5)
2. **Has significant equity** (0.5-2%+ typically, sometimes more)
3. **Makes architectural decisions** that persist for years
4. **Wears multiple hats** - not just writing code but shaping product, hiring, maybe talking to customers
5. **Takes real risk** - below-market salary, uncertain outcome

Hire #5 who joins with 0.1% and a defined role? That's early employee, not founding engineer.

Hire #2 who gets 1.5%, builds the entire initial system, and influences product direction? Founding engineer.

**The cynical view:** "Founding engineer" is also sometimes used as a recruiting carrot when founders can't/won't give a co-founder title but want to attract top talent with something sexier than "Senior Engineer."

**Practical cutoff:** If the company has a working product with customers and established engineering practices when you join, you're probably not a founding engineer regardless of headcount.

What's the context - are you evaluating a role or defining one?

Look at the actual deck and the hires, and I think that I'm trying to decide if I should focus on hiring the engineer first or hiring the forward deployed person first. In which case, I would be acting as the engineer.

The user is showing me their pitch deck for "Director" - an AI-native backbone for nonprofits. They're the CEO & Founder (Bosko Kante) and they're trying to decide the hiring order:

1. Forward-Deployed Director (hire #1) - Nonprofit ops + fundraising, embedded across first ~4 orgs
2. Finance Director (hire #2) - Finance + ops across pod, designs playbooks
3. Founding Engineer (hire #3) - Director OS + first wave of agents

They're asking: should they hire the engineer first (making engineer hire #1) while they act as the forward-deployed person, OR keep the current order where they hire forward-deployed first and act as the engineer themselves?

Let me think about this:

**If Bosko acts as the engineer (hire Forward-Deployed first):**
- He's a "technical founder" per his bio, so he can build
- Forward-Deployed person handles nonprofit relationships, ops, fundraising
- But he's also supposed to do "vision, sales, fundraising, relationships" - that overlaps heavily with Forward-Deployed

**If Bosko acts as Forward-Deployed (hire Engineer first):**
- He keeps doing sales, fundraising, relationships (his stated role)
- Engineer builds the "Director OS + first wave of agents"
- But then he's not leveraging his technical skills

Key considerations:
1. What's the product? "Director OS + first wave of agents" - this is AI/tech heavy
2. What stage are they at? Pre-raise, targeting ~$1M
3. His background: Technical founder, built HiiiWAV, deep nonprofit experience

My take: Given he's a technical founder with deep nonprofit experience, he's actually uniquely positioned to be the Forward-Deployed person himself while hiring an engineer. Here's why:

- He already has the nonprofit relationships and understanding
- The Forward-Deployed role is about embedding in orgs - his existing network
- An engineer building "Director OS" needs deep technical focus


- As CEO doing fundraising, he'll be talking to nonprofits anyway

The forward-deployed role presents unique hiring challenges. It demands a rare combination of nonprofit expertise, operational skills, and the ability to build deep organizational trust. An engineer, by contrast, can be more systematically recruited with clear technical specifications. 

I'd recommend Bosko focus on the forward-deployed work, leveraging his existing network and nonprofit insights, while simultaneously searching for a technically skilled engineer who can translate his vision into the Director OS.</details></think>

Ah, now I get it. You're deciding whether to be the builder or the business dev person for the first stretch.

**My opinion: Hire the engineer first. You be Forward-Deployed.**

Here's why:

1. **Your background is the moat for Forward-Deployed.** You have "deep experience building and supporting nonprofits in the arts and social impact space." That's not hireable at hire #1 salary. The Forward-Deployed role requires instant credibility with nonprofit EDs - you have that, a random hire doesn't.

2. **Forward-Deployed is the sales/customer success hybrid.** You listed your role as "vision, sales, fundraising, relationships" - that's 80% overlap with Forward-Deployed. You'd be hiring someone to do what you should be doing anyway.

3. **Engineer is more fungible early.** If you can spec the system well, a strong engineer can build it. Finding someone who can walk into 4 nonprofits, earn trust, run ops, AND feed product insights back? That's a unicorn at early-stage comp.

4. **You'll learn what to build.** Being embedded in the first orgs means you're gathering the insights that shape "Director OS." Outsourcing that to hire #1 means playing telephone with your own product vision.

5. **Fundraising optics.** "Technical founder doing customer discovery while engineer builds" is a cleaner story than "Technical founder building while ops person talks to customers."

**The risk:** You slow down product velocity. But at pre-seed with ~4 orgs, learning > shipping speed.

Does the founding engineer role require iOS/Swift (given your codebase), or is Director OS web/backend?

Okay, I agree. Switch the slide. Change the order of hires and make the engineer the first hire.

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Ask)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking me to make edits to their codebase - specifically to change the order of hires on their pitch deck slide. However, I'm in Ask mode, which means I cannot make any edits or changes to the system.

I need to politely remind them that I'm in Ask mode and can only provide information and guidance, not make actual changes. I should suggest they switch to Agent mode if they want me to make the changes.</details></think>

I'm in Ask mode right now, so I can't make edits. Switch me to Agent mode (or Normal/Edit mode) and I'll update the slide to make Founding Engineer hire #1 and Forward-Deployed Director hire #2.

Cover\\nDirector\\n The AI-native operating system and forward-deployed backbone for nonprofits\\nTurning under-resourced founders into fundable, operationally tight organizations\\n\\n\\ndirectorforgood.org\\n\\n\\n[Your Name], Founder &amp;amp; CEO\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Problem – Founders Are the Whole Leadership Team\\nNonprofit founders are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary.\\nThey’re expected to:\\nLead programs and vision\\n\\n\\nRaise money (major gifts, grants, events)\\n\\n\\nRun operations and finance\\n\\n\\nOwn communications and storytelling\\n\\n\\nManage staff, boards, and compliance\\n\\n\\nWhen funding tightens and staff are cut, all of this collapses back onto one person.\\n Promising orgs plateau at $300–600k or quietly shut down — not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone.\\n\\n3. Problem – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)\\nOur initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.\\nThese orgs:\\n\\n\\nHave real donor and community relationships\\n\\n\\nHave a history of 7-figure budgets or close\\n\\n\\nBut in the current funding environment:\\n\\n\\nThey’ve laid off staff\\n\\n\\nThe founder is back to doing everything\\n\\n\\nMany are considering shutting down despite strong demand for their work\\n\\n\\nThis hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches and flexible money disappears.\\n\\n\\nThese leaders don’t need another tool. They need a backbone.\\n\\n4. Broken Options\\nExisting solutions don’t fit this stage.\\nDIY SaaS stack\\n\\n\\nCRMs, grant tools, accounting, email…\\n\\n\\nFounders don’t have time (or staff) to integrate and maintain them.\\n\\n\\nConsultants &amp;amp; agencies\\n\\n\\nProject-based, expensive, and seen as “overhead.”\\n\\n\\nAdvice without ongoing operational responsibility.\\n\\n\\nRebuilding staff\\n\\n\\nBay Area-ish:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDevelopment: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\n$360–450k/year just for the backbone on a fragile budget.\\n\\n\\nThere is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.\\n\\n5. Director – What We Are\\nDirector is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.\\nWe provide:\\nDirector OS – a vertical operating system for:\\n\\n\\nRevenue &amp;amp; relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; finance\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; compliance\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; funder narratives\\n\\n\\nA Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops leadership\\n\\n\\nLater: dedicated development &amp;amp; ops roles as we scale\\n\\n\\nWe plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can’t afford to rebuild alone.\\n\\n6. Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\nDurable funding comes from:\\n\\n\\nMajor donors\\n\\n\\nAnchor institutions\\n\\n\\nLong-term partners\\n\\n\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\n\\n\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\n\\n\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\n\\n\\nDirector’s focus:\\n\\n\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\n\\n\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\n\\n\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\n\\n\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\n\\n7. The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp (Lean First, Then Scale)\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\nYear 1 – Lean “Proto-Pod”\\nTeam:\\n\\n\\nYou (Founder/CEO)\\n\\n\\n1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\n1 Finance Director (covering finance + ops)\\n\\n\\n1 Founding Engineer\\n\\n\\nCapacity:\\n\\n\\nFDD deeply embedded with up to 4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director builds cross-org finance/ops playbooks and workflows\\n\\n\\nEngineer builds Director OS + first agents alongside you\\n\\n\\nPhase 2 – 8 orgs\\nMature core agents take on most repetitive finance/ops/reporting tasks\\n\\n\\nSame FDD + Finance Director structure supports more orgs, with additional FDD capacity added as needed\\n\\n\\nPhase 3 – 16 orgs\\n2+ FDDs each focused on 4–6 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops/development leadership scaled across all 16 using agents and standardized playbooks\\n\\n\\nAgents perform the recurring work; Pods focus on relationships and decisions.\\n\\n8. Director OS – Product Overview\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\nDirector OS brings together:\\nRevenue &amp;amp; Relationships\\n\\n\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\n\\n\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; Finance\\n\\n\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\n\\n\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance\\n\\n\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nChecklists and playbooks\\n\\n\\nNarratives &amp;amp; Reporting\\n\\n\\nBoard decks and updates\\n\\n\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\n\\n\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\n\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\nExamples:\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\n\\n\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\n\\n\\nMaintains relationship maps\\n\\n\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\n\\n\\nFinance &amp;amp; Runway Agent\\n\\n\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\n\\n\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\n\\n\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\n\\n\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\n\\n\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\n\\n\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\n\\n\\nPattern:\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\n\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDev: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\n\\n\\nWith Director:\\n\\n\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\n\\n\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\n\\n\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\n\\n\\n\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\n\\n\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\n\\n\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\n\\n\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\n\\n\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\n\\n\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\n\\n\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\n\\n12. Go-to-Market\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\nExisting relationships\\n\\n\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\n\\n\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\n\\n\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\n\\n\\nFunder collaborations\\n\\n\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\n\\n\\nSales motion:\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\n\\n\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\n\\n\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\n\\n\\n\\n13. Business Model &amp;amp; QSBS-Friendly Structure\\nAI-native vertical SaaS with embedded forward-deployed team.\\nRevenue model\\n\\n\\nAnnual retainers per org, tied to budget band and complexity\\n\\n\\nLong-term goal: multiple Pods, each supporting up to 16 orgs on the OS\\n\\n\\nCost structure\\n\\n\\nLean Pods (FDD + Finance Director) supported by agents and product\\n\\n\\nFounder &amp;amp; Engineer drive product/agent development that compounds across all clients\\n\\n\\nQSBS-aware design\\n\\n\\nU.S. C-corp, building an active, product-centric operating business\\n\\n\\nAssets are primarily software, data models, and operating infrastructure\\n\\n\\nCompany is structured so founders and early investors can potentially access QSBS benefits (subject to their own tax advice)\\n\\n\\n\\n14. Team – Lean Year-1 Plan\\nSmall, high-leverage founding team with 12 months of runway.\\nFounder &amp;amp; CEO (you)\\n\\n\\nProduct vision, sales, fundraising, relationships\\n\\n\\nActs as early FDD alongside hire as needed\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (hire #1)\\n\\n\\nDeep nonprofit ops + fundraising\\n\\n\\nEmbedded across the first ~4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director (hire #2)\\n\\n\\nCovers finance + ops across the initial pod\\n\\n\\nDesigns playbooks the agents will run\\n\\n\\nFounding Engineer (hire #3)\\n\\n\\nBuilds Director OS and the first wave of agents with you\\n\\n\\nTarget raise for ~12 months runway (illustrative):\\nLean team + non-people costs → roughly $800k–$1M\\n\\n\\nEarly org retainers reduce net burn as you ramp to 4 paying customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n15. Roadmap &amp;amp; Ask\\nRoadmap\\n0–12 months (this raise):\\n\\n\\nHire FDD, Finance Director, Founding Engineer\\n\\n\\nOnboard 2–4 orgs\\n\\n\\nShip v1 Director OS and core agents (finance, ops, reporting, major gifts support)\\n\\n\\nProve: 4-org pod with agents delivers clear revenue and stability lift\\n\\n\\n12–24 months:\\n\\n\\nScale pod to 8 orgs\\n\\n\\nHarden agents and playbooks\\n\\n\\nAdd additional FDD/finance/ops capacity as revenues justify\\n\\n\\n24+ months:\\n\\n\\n16-org pods on mature OS\\n\\n\\nMultiple pods focused on key verticals (arts, youth, community, etc.)\\n\\n\\nAsk\\nRaise $800k–$1.0M to:\\n\\n\\nFund 12+ months of lean team and product development\\n\\n\\nProve the 4 → 8 → 16 org capacity story with real customers\\n\\n\\nBuild Director into the AI-native backbone for the orgs that can least afford to lose theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\","

Cover\\\\nDirector\\\\n The AI-native operating system and forward-deployed backbone for nonprofits\\\\nTurning under-resourced founders into fundable, operationally tight organizations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndirectorforgood.org\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Your Name], Founder &amp;amp;amp; CEO\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. Problem – Founders Are the Whole Leadership Team\\\\nNonprofit founders are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary.\\\\nThey’re expected to:\\\\nLead programs and vision\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRaise money (major gifts, grants, events)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRun operations and finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOwn communications and storytelling\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nManage staff, boards, and compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen funding tightens and staff are cut, all of this collapses back onto one person.\\\\n Promising orgs plateau at $300–600k or quietly shut down — not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone.\\\\n\\\\n3. Problem – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)\\\\nOur initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.\\\\nThese orgs:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave real donor and community relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave a history of 7-figure budgets or close\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBut in the current funding environment:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThey’ve laid off staff\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe founder is back to doing everything\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMany are considering shutting down despite strong demand for their work\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches and flexible money disappears.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThese leaders don’t need another tool. They need a backbone.\\\\n\\\\n4. Broken Options\\\\nExisting solutions don’t fit this stage.\\\\nDIY SaaS stack\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCRMs, grant tools, accounting, email…\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFounders don’t have time (or staff) to integrate and maintain them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsultants &amp;amp;amp; agencies\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProject-based, expensive, and seen as “overhead.”\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdvice without ongoing operational responsibility.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRebuilding staff\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBay Area-ish:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDevelopment: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$360–450k/year just for the backbone on a fragile budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.\\\\n\\\\n5. Director – What We Are\\\\nDirector is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.\\\\nWe provide:\\\\nDirector OS – a vertical operating system for:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRevenue &amp;amp;amp; relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRunway &amp;amp;amp; finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard &amp;amp;amp; funder narratives\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nForward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance/ops leadership\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLater: dedicated development &amp;amp;amp; ops roles as we scale\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can’t afford to rebuild alone.\\\\n\\\\n6. Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\\\nDurable funding comes from:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMajor donors\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnchor institutions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-term partners\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector’s focus:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\\\n\\\\n7. The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp (Lean First, Then Scale)\\\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\\\nYear 1 – Lean “Proto-Pod”\\\\nTeam:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou (Founder/CEO)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Finance Director (covering finance + ops)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Founding Engineer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCapacity:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFDD deeply embedded with up to 4 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance Director builds cross-org finance/ops playbooks and workflows\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEngineer builds Director OS + first agents alongside you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPhase 2 – 8 orgs\\\\nMature core agents take on most repetitive finance/ops/reporting tasks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSame FDD + Finance Director structure supports more orgs, with additional FDD capacity added as needed\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPhase 3 – 16 orgs\\\\n2+ FDDs each focused on 4–6 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance/ops/development leadership scaled across all 16 using agents and standardized playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAgents perform the recurring work; Pods focus on relationships and decisions.\\\\n\\\\n8. Director OS – Product Overview\\\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\\\nDirector OS brings together:\\\\nRevenue &amp;amp;amp; Relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRunway &amp;amp;amp; Finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; Compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChecklists and playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNarratives &amp;amp;amp; Reporting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard decks and updates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\\\n\\\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\\\nExamples:\\\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaintains relationship maps\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance &amp;amp;amp; Runway Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard &amp;amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPattern:\\\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\\\n\\\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDev: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith Director:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\\\n\\\\n12. Go-to-Market\\\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\\\nExisting relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunder collaborations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSales motion:\\\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n13. Business Model &amp;amp;amp; QSBS-Friendly Structure\\\\nAI-native vertical SaaS with embedded forward-deployed team.\\\\nRevenue model\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnnual retainers per org, tied to budget band and complexity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-term goal: multiple Pods, each supporting up to 16 orgs on the OS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCost structure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLean Pods (FDD + Finance Director) supported by agents and product\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFounder &amp;amp;amp; Engineer drive product/agent development that compounds across all clients\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQSBS-aware design\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. C-corp, building an active, product-centric operating business\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAssets are primarily software, data models, and operating infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompany is structured so founders and early investors can potentially access QSBS benefits (subject to their own tax advice)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n14. Team – Lean Year-1 Plan\\\\nSmall, high-leverage founding team with 12 months of runway.\\\\nFounder &amp;amp;amp; CEO (you)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProduct vision, sales, fundraising, relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nActs as early FDD alongside hire as needed\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nForward-Deployed Director (hire #1)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDeep nonprofit ops + fundraising\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEmbedded across the first ~4 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance Director (hire #2)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCovers finance + ops across the initial pod\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDesigns playbooks the agents will run\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFounding Engineer (hire #3)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBuilds Director OS and the first wave of agents with you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTarget raise for ~12 months runway (illustrative):\\\\nLean team + non-people costs → roughly $800k–$1M\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEarly org retainers reduce net burn as you ramp to 4 paying customers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n15. Roadmap &amp;amp;amp; Ask\\\\nRoadmap\\\\n0–12 months (this raise):\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHire FDD, Finance Director, Founding Engineer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnboard 2–4 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShip v1 Director OS and core agents (finance, ops, reporting, major gifts support)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProve: 4-org pod with agents delivers clear revenue and stability lift\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n12–24 months:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScale pod to 8 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHarden agents and playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdd additional FDD/finance/ops capacity as revenues justify\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n24+ months:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n16-org pods on mature OS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMultiple pods focused on key verticals (arts, youth, community, etc.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAsk\\\\nRaise $800k–$1.0M to:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFund 12+ months of lean team and product development\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProve the 4 → 8 → 16 org capacity story with real customers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBuild Director into the AI-native backbone for the orgs that can least afford to lose theirs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\",\""

Problem – Founders Are the Whole Leadership Team\\\\nNonprofit founders are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary.\\\\nThey’re expected to:\\\\nLead programs and vision\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRaise money (major gifts, grants, events)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRun operations and finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOwn communications and storytelling\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nManage staff, boards, and compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen funding tightens and staff are cut, all of this collapses back onto one person.\\\\n Promising orgs plateau at $300–600k or quietly shut down — not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone.\\\\n\\\\n3. Problem – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)\\\\nOur initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.\\\\nThese orgs:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave real donor and community relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave a history of 7-figure budgets or close\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBut in the current funding environment:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThey’ve laid off staff\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe founder is back to doing everything\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMany are considering shutting down despite strong demand for their work\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches and flexible money disappears.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThese leaders don’t need another tool. They need a backbone.\\\\n\\\\n4. Broken Options\\\\nExisting solutions don’t fit this stage.\\\\nDIY SaaS stack\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCRMs, grant tools, accounting, email…\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFounders don’t have time (or staff) to integrate and maintain them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsultants &amp;amp;amp; agencies\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProject-based, expensive, and seen as “overhead.”\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdvice without ongoing operational responsibility.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRebuilding staff\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBay Area-ish:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDevelopment: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$360–450k/year just for the backbone on a fragile budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.\\\\n\\\\n5. Director – What We Are\\\\nDirector is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.\\\\nWe provide:\\\\nDirector OS – a vertical operating system for:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRevenue &amp;amp;amp; relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRunway &amp;amp;amp; finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard &amp;amp;amp; funder narratives\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nForward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance/ops leadership\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLater: dedicated development &amp;amp;amp; ops roles as we scale\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can’t afford to rebuild alone.\\\\n\\\\n6. Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\\\nDurable funding comes from:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMajor donors\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnchor institutions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-term partners\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector’s focus:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\\\n\\\\n7. The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp (Lean First, Then Scale)\\\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\\\nYear 1 – Lean “Proto-Pod”\\\\nTeam:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou (Founder/CEO)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Finance Director (covering finance + ops)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Founding Engineer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCapacity:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFDD deeply embedded with up to 4 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance Director builds cross-org finance/ops playbooks and workflows\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEngineer builds Director OS + first agents alongside you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPhase 2 – 8 orgs\\\\nMature core agents take on most repetitive finance/ops/reporting tasks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSame FDD + Finance Director structure supports more orgs, with additional FDD capacity added as needed\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPhase 3 – 16 orgs\\\\n2+ FDDs each focused on 4–6 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance/ops/development leadership scaled across all 16 using agents and standardized playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAgents perform the recurring work; Pods focus on relationships and decisions.\\\\n\\\\n8. Director OS – Product Overview\\\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\\\nDirector OS brings together:\\\\nRevenue &amp;amp;amp; Relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRunway &amp;amp;amp; Finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; Compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChecklists and playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNarratives &amp;amp;amp; Reporting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard decks and updates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\\\n\\\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\\\nExamples:\\\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaintains relationship maps\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance &amp;amp;amp; Runway Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard &amp;amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPattern:\\\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\\\n\\\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDev: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith Director:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\\\n\\\\n12. Go-to-Market\\\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\\\nExisting relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunder collaborations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSales motion:\\\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n13.

We help under-resourced nonprofit founders become fundable, operationally tight organizations by providing the leadership capacity they can't afford to rebuild alone.\\\\n\\\\n**Who is Director for?**\\\\nDirector serves nonprofit founders who are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary - leading programs, raising money, running operations, managing communications, and handling compliance. Our initial focus is on \\\\\\\"downshifted orgs\\\\\\\" - organizations that previously had $400K-$1M budgets but have had to lay off staff due to funding pressures.\\\\n\\\\n**How does Director work?**\\\\nDirector combines two components:\\\\n1. **Director OS** - A vertical operating system covering revenue &amp;amp;amp; relationships, runway &amp;amp;amp; finance, ops &amp;amp;amp; compliance, and board &amp;amp;amp; funder narratives\\\\n2. **Director Pod** - Shared leadership capacity including a Forward-Deployed Director (FDD), finance/ops leadership, and dedicated support roles\\\\n\\\\n**What problem does Director solve?**\\\\nPromising nonprofits plateau at $300-600K or quietly shut down - not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone. When funding tightens and staff are cut, all leadership responsibilities collapse back onto one person. Director provides the integrated, AI-native backbone these organizations need.\\\\n\\\\n## How Director Helps\\\\n\\\\n**What does Director OS include?**\\\\n- Revenue &amp;amp;amp; Relationships: Major gifts map, warm pipeline, next-best actions\\\\n- Runway &amp;amp;amp; Finance: Live cash forecasts, budget vs actuals visibility\\\\n- Ops &amp;amp;amp; Compliance: Recurring task engine, checklists, playbooks\\\\n- Narratives &amp;amp;amp; Reporting: Board decks, funder reports, impact one-pagers\\\\n\\\\n**What are AI Agents?**\\\\nDirector uses specialized AI agents that handle repetitive work while humans focus on judgment:\\\\n- Major Gifts Agent: Scans email, calendar, CRM; maintains relationship maps; drafts donor communications\\\\n- Finance &amp;amp;amp; Runway Agent: Pulls accounting data, proposes categorizations, raises runway alerts\\\\n- Ops &amp;amp;amp; Compliance Agent: Runs checklists, generates reminders, manages task lists\\\\n- Board &amp;amp;amp; Reporting Agent: Assembles board decks, creates funder reports\\\\n\\\\n**What is a Director Pod?**\\\\nA Director Pod is a shared leadership team that serves multiple nonprofit organizations. Year 1 structure includes:\\\\n- Founder/CEO\\\\n- 1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\\\n- 1 Finance Director\\\\n- 1 Founding Engineer\\\\n\\\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\\\n\\\\n## Economics &amp;amp;amp; Pricing\\\\n\\\\n**How much does Director cost?**\\\\nDirector Pod services cost approximately $80-120K/year per organization, compared to $360-450K/year for traditional backbone staffing (ED, Ops/Finance, Development, Comms roles).\\\\n\\\\n**What's the savings?**\\\\nOrganizations can save $100-180K/year in backbone costs while getting better coverage through AI-augmented human leadership.\\\\n\\\\n## For Foundations\\\\n\\\\n**Can foundations sponsor multiple organizations?**\\\\nYes! Foundations are an ideal customer segment. A single foundation can purchase Director packages for 5-10 grantees at once, providing:\\\\n- Measurable capacity ROI across their portfolio\\\\n- Backbone support that individual orgs couldn't afford alone\\\\n- One contract covering multiple organizations\\\\n\\\\n**How do foundation partnerships work?**\\\\nContact us to discuss capacity-building investments in your grantee portfolio.

Cover\\\\nDirector\\\\n The AI-native operating system and forward-deployed backbone for nonprofits\\\\nTurning under-resourced founders into fundable, operationally tight organizations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndirectorforgood.org\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[Your Name], Founder &amp;amp;amp; CEO\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n2. Problem – Founders Are the Whole Leadership Team\\\\nNonprofit founders are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary.\\\\nThey’re expected to:\\\\nLead programs and vision\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRaise money (major gifts, grants, events)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRun operations and finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOwn communications and storytelling\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nManage staff, boards, and compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhen funding tightens and staff are cut, all of this collapses back onto one person.\\\\n Promising orgs plateau at $300–600k or quietly shut down — not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone.\\\\n\\\\n3. Problem – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)\\\\nOur initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.\\\\nThese orgs:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave real donor and community relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHave a history of 7-figure budgets or close\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBut in the current funding environment:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThey’ve laid off staff\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe founder is back to doing everything\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMany are considering shutting down despite strong demand for their work\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches and flexible money disappears.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThese leaders don’t need another tool. They need a backbone.\\\\n\\\\n4. Broken Options\\\\nExisting solutions don’t fit this stage.\\\\nDIY SaaS stack\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCRMs, grant tools, accounting, email…\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFounders don’t have time (or staff) to integrate and maintain them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nConsultants &amp;amp;amp; agencies\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProject-based, expensive, and seen as “overhead.”\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdvice without ongoing operational responsibility.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRebuilding staff\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBay Area-ish:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDevelopment: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n$360–450k/year just for the backbone on a fragile budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.\\\\n\\\\n5. Director – What We Are\\\\nDirector is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.\\\\nWe provide:\\\\nDirector OS – a vertical operating system for:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRevenue &amp;amp;amp; relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRunway &amp;amp;amp; finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard &amp;amp;amp; funder narratives\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nForward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance/ops leadership\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLater: dedicated development &amp;amp;amp; ops roles as we scale\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWe plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can’t afford to rebuild alone.\\\\n\\\\n6. Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\\\nDurable funding comes from:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMajor donors\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnchor institutions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-term partners\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector’s focus:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\\\n\\\\n7. The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp (Lean First, Then Scale)\\\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\\\nYear 1 – Lean “Proto-Pod”\\\\nTeam:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYou (Founder/CEO)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Finance Director (covering finance + ops)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1 Founding Engineer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCapacity:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFDD deeply embedded with up to 4 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance Director builds cross-org finance/ops playbooks and workflows\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEngineer builds Director OS + first agents alongside you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPhase 2 – 8 orgs\\\\nMature core agents take on most repetitive finance/ops/reporting tasks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSame FDD + Finance Director structure supports more orgs, with additional FDD capacity added as needed\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPhase 3 – 16 orgs\\\\n2+ FDDs each focused on 4–6 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance/ops/development leadership scaled across all 16 using agents and standardized playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAgents perform the recurring work; Pods focus on relationships and decisions.\\\\n\\\\n8. Director OS – Product Overview\\\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\\\nDirector OS brings together:\\\\nRevenue &amp;amp;amp; Relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRunway &amp;amp;amp; Finance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; Compliance\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChecklists and playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNarratives &amp;amp;amp; Reporting\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard decks and updates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\\\n\\\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\\\nExamples:\\\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMaintains relationship maps\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance &amp;amp;amp; Runway Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps &amp;amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBoard &amp;amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPattern:\\\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\\\n\\\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDev: ~100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWith Director:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\\\n\\\\n12. Go-to-Market\\\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\\\nExisting relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFunder collaborations\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSales motion:\\\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n13. Business Model &amp;amp;amp; QSBS-Friendly Structure\\\\nAI-native vertical SaaS with embedded forward-deployed team.\\\\nRevenue model\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnnual retainers per org, tied to budget band and complexity\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-term goal: multiple Pods, each supporting up to 16 orgs on the OS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCost structure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLean Pods (FDD + Finance Director) supported by agents and product\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFounder &amp;amp;amp; Engineer drive product/agent development that compounds across all clients\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQSBS-aware design\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nU.S. C-corp, building an active, product-centric operating business\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAssets are primarily software, data models, and operating infrastructure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCompany is structured so founders and early investors can potentially access QSBS benefits (subject to their own tax advice)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n14. Team – Lean Year-1 Plan\\\\nSmall, high-leverage founding team with 12 months of runway.\\\\nFounder &amp;amp;amp; CEO (you)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProduct vision, sales, fundraising, relationships\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nActs as early FDD alongside hire as needed\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nForward-Deployed Director (hire #1)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDeep nonprofit ops + fundraising\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEmbedded across the first ~4 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFinance Director (hire #2)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCovers finance + ops across the initial pod\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDesigns playbooks the agents will run\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFounding Engineer (hire #3)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBuilds Director OS and the first wave of agents with you\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTarget raise for ~12 months runway (illustrative):\\\\nLean team + non-people costs → roughly $800k–$1M\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nEarly org retainers reduce net burn as you ramp to 4 paying customers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n15. Roadmap &amp;amp;amp; Ask\\\\nRoadmap\\\\n0–12 months (this raise):\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHire FDD, Finance Director, Founding Engineer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOnboard 2–4 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShip v1 Director OS and core agents (finance, ops, reporting, major gifts support)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProve: 4-org pod with agents delivers clear revenue and stability lift\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n12–24 months:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nScale pod to 8 orgs\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHarden agents and playbooks\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAdd additional FDD/finance/ops capacity as revenues justify\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n24+ months:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n16-org pods on mature OS\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMultiple pods focused on key verticals (arts, youth, community, etc.)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAsk\\\\nRaise $800k–$1.0M to:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFund 12+ months of lean team and product development\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nProve the 4 → 8 → 16 org capacity story with real customers\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBuild Director into the AI-native backbone for the orgs that can least afford to lose theirs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\",\""

Broken Options\\nExisting solutions don’t fit this stage.\\nDIY SaaS stack\\n\\n\\nCRMs, grant tools, accounting, email…\\n\\n\\nFounders don’t have time (or staff) to integrate and maintain them.\\n\\n\\nConsultants &amp;amp; agencies\\n\\n\\nProject-based, expensive, and seen as “overhead.”\\n\\n\\nAdvice without ongoing operational responsibility.\\n\\n\\nRebuilding staff\\n\\n\\nBay Area-ish:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDevelopment: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\n$360–450k/year just for the backbone on a fragile budget.\\n\\n\\nThere is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.\\n\\n5. Director – What We Are\\nDirector is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.\\nWe provide:\\nDirector OS – a vertical operating system for:\\n\\n\\nRevenue &amp;amp; relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; finance\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; compliance\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; funder narratives\\n\\n\\nA Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops leadership\\n\\n\\nLater: dedicated development &amp;amp; ops roles as we scale\\n\\n\\nWe plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can’t afford to rebuild alone.\\n\\n6. Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\nDurable funding comes from:\\n\\n\\nMajor donors\\n\\n\\nAnchor institutions\\n\\n\\nLong-term partners\\n\\n\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\n\\n\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\n\\n\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\n\\n\\nDirector’s focus:\\n\\n\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\n\\n\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\n\\n\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\n\\n\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\n\\n7. The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp (Lean First, Then Scale)\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\nYear 1 – Lean “Proto-Pod”\\nTeam:\\n\\n\\nYou (Founder/CEO)\\n\\n\\n1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\n1 Finance Director (covering finance + ops)\\n\\n\\n1 Founding Engineer\\n\\n\\nCapacity:\\n\\n\\nFDD deeply embedded with up to 4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director builds cross-org finance/ops playbooks and workflows\\n\\n\\nEngineer builds Director OS + first agents alongside you\\n\\n\\nPhase 2 – 8 orgs\\nMature core agents take on most repetitive finance/ops/reporting tasks\\n\\n\\nSame FDD + Finance Director structure supports more orgs, with additional FDD capacity added as needed\\n\\n\\nPhase 3 – 16 orgs\\n2+ FDDs each focused on 4–6 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops/development leadership scaled across all 16 using agents and standardized playbooks\\n\\n\\nAgents perform the recurring work; Pods focus on relationships and decisions.\\n\\n8. Director OS – Product Overview\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\nDirector OS brings together:\\nRevenue &amp;amp; Relationships\\n\\n\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\n\\n\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; Finance\\n\\n\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\n\\n\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance\\n\\n\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nChecklists and playbooks\\n\\n\\nNarratives &amp;amp; Reporting\\n\\n\\nBoard decks and updates\\n\\n\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\n\\n\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\n\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\nExamples:\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\n\\n\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\n\\n\\nMaintains relationship maps\\n\\n\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\n\\n\\nFinance &amp;amp; Runway Agent\\n\\n\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\n\\n\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\n\\n\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\n\\n\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\n\\n\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\n\\n\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\n\\n\\nPattern:\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\n\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDev: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\n\\n\\nWith Director:\\n\\n\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\n\\n\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\n\\n\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\n\\n\\n\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\n\\n\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\n\\n\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\n\\n\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\n\\n\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\n\\n\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\n\\n\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\n\\n12. Go-to-Market\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\nExisting relationships\\n\\n\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\n\\n\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\n\\n\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\n\\n\\nFunder collaborations\\n\\n\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\n\\n\\nSales motion:\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\n\\n\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\n\\n\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\n\\n\\n\\n13. Business Model &amp;amp; QSBS-Friendly Structure\\nAI-native vertical SaaS with embedded forward-deployed team.\\nRevenue model\\n\\n\\nAnnual retainers per org, tied to budget band and complexity\\n\\n\\nLong-term goal: multiple Pods, each supporting up to 16 orgs on the OS\\n\\n\\nCost structure\\n\\n\\nLean Pods (FDD + Finance Director) supported by agents and product\\n\\n\\nFounder &amp;amp; Engineer drive product/agent development that compounds across all clients\\n\\n\\nQSBS-aware design\\n\\n\\nU.S. C-corp, building an active, product-centric operating business\\n\\n\\nAssets are primarily software, data models, and operating infrastructure\\n\\n\\nCompany is structured so founders and early investors can potentially access QSBS benefits (subject to their own tax advice)\\n\\n\\n\\n14. Team – Lean Year-1 Plan\\nSmall, high-leverage founding team with 12 months of runway.\\nFounder &amp;amp; CEO (you)\\n\\n\\nProduct vision, sales, fundraising, relationships\\n\\n\\nActs as early FDD alongside hire as needed\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (hire #1)\\n\\n\\nDeep nonprofit ops + fundraising\\n\\n\\nEmbedded across the first ~4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director (hire #2)\\n\\n\\nCovers finance + ops across the initial pod\\n\\n\\nDesigns playbooks the agents will run\\n\\n\\nFounding Engineer (hire #3)\\n\\n\\nBuilds Director OS and the first wave of agents with you\\n\\n\\nTarget raise for ~12 months runway (illustrative):\\nLean team + non-people costs → roughly $800k–$1M\\n\\n\\nEarly org retainers reduce net burn as you ramp to 4 paying customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n15. Roadmap &amp;amp; Ask\\nRoadmap\\n0–12 months (this raise):\\n\\n\\nHire FDD, Finance Director, Founding Engineer\\n\\n\\nOnboard 2–4 orgs\\n\\n\\nShip v1 Director OS and core agents (finance, ops, reporting, major gifts support)\\n\\n\\nProve: 4-org pod with agents delivers clear revenue and stability lift\\n\\n\\n12–24 months:\\n\\n\\nScale pod to 8 orgs\\n\\n\\nHarden agents and playbooks\\n\\n\\nAdd additional FDD/finance/ops capacity as revenues justify\\n\\n\\n24+ months:\\n\\n\\n16-org pods on mature OS\\n\\n\\nMultiple pods focused on key verticals (arts, youth, community, etc.)\\n\\n\\nAsk\\nRaise $800k–$1.0M to:\\n\\n\\nFund 12+ months of lean team and product development\\n\\n\\nProve the 4 → 8 → 16 org capacity story with real customers\\n\\n\\nBuild Director into the AI-native backbone for the orgs that can least afford to lose theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\","

Problem – Founders Are the Whole Leadership Team\\nNonprofit founders are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary.\\nThey’re expected to:\\nLead programs and vision\\n\\n\\nRaise money (major gifts, grants, events)\\n\\n\\nRun operations and finance\\n\\n\\nOwn communications and storytelling\\n\\n\\nManage staff, boards, and compliance\\n\\n\\nWhen funding tightens and staff are cut, all of this collapses back onto one person.\\n Promising orgs plateau at $300–600k or quietly shut down — not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone.\\n\\n3. Problem – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)\\nOur initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.\\nThese orgs:\\n\\n\\nHave real donor and community relationships\\n\\n\\nHave a history of 7-figure budgets or close\\n\\n\\nBut in the current funding environment:\\n\\n\\nThey’ve laid off staff\\n\\n\\nThe founder is back to doing everything\\n\\n\\nMany are considering shutting down despite strong demand for their work\\n\\n\\nThis hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches and flexible money disappears.\\n\\n\\nThese leaders don’t need another tool. They need a backbone.\\n\\n4. Broken Options\\nExisting solutions don’t fit this stage.\\nDIY SaaS stack\\n\\n\\nCRMs, grant tools, accounting, email…\\n\\n\\nFounders don’t have time (or staff) to integrate and maintain them.\\n\\n\\nConsultants &amp;amp; agencies\\n\\n\\nProject-based, expensive, and seen as “overhead.”\\n\\n\\nAdvice without ongoing operational responsibility.\\n\\n\\nRebuilding staff\\n\\n\\nBay Area-ish:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDevelopment: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\n$360–450k/year just for the backbone on a fragile budget.\\n\\n\\nThere is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.\\n\\n5. Director – What We Are\\nDirector is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.\\nWe provide:\\nDirector OS – a vertical operating system for:\\n\\n\\nRevenue &amp;amp; relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; finance\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; compliance\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; funder narratives\\n\\n\\nA Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops leadership\\n\\n\\nLater: dedicated development &amp;amp; ops roles as we scale\\n\\n\\nWe plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can’t afford to rebuild alone.\\n\\n6. Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\nDurable funding comes from:\\n\\n\\nMajor donors\\n\\n\\nAnchor institutions\\n\\n\\nLong-term partners\\n\\n\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\n\\n\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\n\\n\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\n\\n\\nDirector’s focus:\\n\\n\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\n\\n\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\n\\n\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\n\\n\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\n\\n7. The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp (Lean First, Then Scale)\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\nYear 1 – Lean “Proto-Pod”\\nTeam:\\n\\n\\nYou (Founder/CEO)\\n\\n\\n1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\n1 Finance Director (covering finance + ops)\\n\\n\\n1 Founding Engineer\\n\\n\\nCapacity:\\n\\n\\nFDD deeply embedded with up to 4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director builds cross-org finance/ops playbooks and workflows\\n\\n\\nEngineer builds Director OS + first agents alongside you\\n\\n\\nPhase 2 – 8 orgs\\nMature core agents take on most repetitive finance/ops/reporting tasks\\n\\n\\nSame FDD + Finance Director structure supports more orgs, with additional FDD capacity added as needed\\n\\n\\nPhase 3 – 16 orgs\\n2+ FDDs each focused on 4–6 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops/development leadership scaled across all 16 using agents and standardized playbooks\\n\\n\\nAgents perform the recurring work; Pods focus on relationships and decisions.\\n\\n8. Director OS – Product Overview\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\nDirector OS brings together:\\nRevenue &amp;amp; Relationships\\n\\n\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\n\\n\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; Finance\\n\\n\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\n\\n\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance\\n\\n\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nChecklists and playbooks\\n\\n\\nNarratives &amp;amp; Reporting\\n\\n\\nBoard decks and updates\\n\\n\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\n\\n\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\n\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\nExamples:\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\n\\n\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\n\\n\\nMaintains relationship maps\\n\\n\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\n\\n\\nFinance &amp;amp; Runway Agent\\n\\n\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\n\\n\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\n\\n\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\n\\n\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\n\\n\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\n\\n\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\n\\n\\nPattern:\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\n\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDev: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\n\\n\\nWith Director:\\n\\n\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\n\\n\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\n\\n\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\n\\n\\n\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\n\\n\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\n\\n\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\n\\n\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\n\\n\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\n\\n\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\n\\n\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\n\\n12. Go-to-Market\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\nExisting relationships\\n\\n\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\n\\n\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\n\\n\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\n\\n\\nFunder collaborations\\n\\n\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\n\\n\\nSales motion:\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\n\\n\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\n\\n\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\n\\n\\n\\n13. Business Model &amp;amp; QSBS-Friendly Structure\\nAI-native vertical SaaS with embedded forward-deployed team.\\nRevenue model\\n\\n\\nAnnual retainers per org, tied to budget band and complexity\\n\\n\\nLong-term goal: multiple Pods, each supporting up to 16 orgs on the OS\\n\\n\\nCost structure\\n\\n\\nLean Pods (FDD + Finance Director) supported by agents and product\\n\\n\\nFounder &amp;amp; Engineer drive product/agent development that compounds across all clients\\n\\n\\nQSBS-aware design\\n\\n\\nU.S. C-corp, building an active, product-centric operating business\\n\\n\\nAssets are primarily software, data models, and operating infrastructure\\n\\n\\nCompany is structured so founders and early investors can potentially access QSBS benefits (subject to their own tax advice)\\n\\n\\n\\n14. Team – Lean Year-1 Plan\\nSmall, high-leverage founding team with 12 months of runway.\\nFounder &amp;amp; CEO (you)\\n\\n\\nProduct vision, sales, fundraising, relationships\\n\\n\\nActs as early FDD alongside hire as needed\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (hire #1)\\n\\n\\nDeep nonprofit ops + fundraising\\n\\n\\nEmbedded across the first ~4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director (hire #2)\\n\\n\\nCovers finance + ops across the initial pod\\n\\n\\nDesigns playbooks the agents will run\\n\\n\\nFounding Engineer (hire #3)\\n\\n\\nBuilds Director OS and the first wave of agents with you\\n\\n\\nTarget raise for ~12 months runway (illustrative):\\nLean team + non-people costs → roughly $800k–$1M\\n\\n\\nEarly org retainers reduce net burn as you ramp to 4 paying customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n15. Roadmap &amp;amp; Ask\\nRoadmap\\n0–12 months (this raise):\\n\\n\\nHire FDD, Finance Director, Founding Engineer\\n\\n\\nOnboard 2–4 orgs\\n\\n\\nShip v1 Director OS and core agents (finance, ops, reporting, major gifts support)\\n\\n\\nProve: 4-org pod with agents delivers clear revenue and stability lift\\n\\n\\n12–24 months:\\n\\n\\nScale pod to 8 orgs\\n\\n\\nHarden agents and playbooks\\n\\n\\nAdd additional FDD/finance/ops capacity as revenues justify\\n\\n\\n24+ months:\\n\\n\\n16-org pods on mature OS\\n\\n\\nMultiple pods focused on key verticals (arts, youth, community, etc.)\\n\\n\\nAsk\\nRaise $800k–$1.0M to:\\n\\n\\nFund 12+ months of lean team and product development\\n\\n\\nProve the 4 → 8 → 16 org capacity story with real customers\\n\\n\\nBuild Director into the AI-native backbone for the orgs that can least afford to lose theirs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\","

Problem – Founders Are the Whole Leadership Team\\nNonprofit founders are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary.\\nThey’re expected to:\\nLead programs and vision\\n\\n\\nRaise money (major gifts, grants, events)\\n\\n\\nRun operations and finance\\n\\n\\nOwn communications and storytelling\\n\\n\\nManage staff, boards, and compliance\\n\\n\\nWhen funding tightens and staff are cut, all of this collapses back onto one person.\\n Promising orgs plateau at $300–600k or quietly shut down — not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone.\\n\\n3. Problem – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)\\nOur initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.\\nThese orgs:\\n\\n\\nHave real donor and community relationships\\n\\n\\nHave a history of 7-figure budgets or close\\n\\n\\nBut in the current funding environment:\\n\\n\\nThey’ve laid off staff\\n\\n\\nThe founder is back to doing everything\\n\\n\\nMany are considering shutting down despite strong demand for their work\\n\\n\\nThis hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches and flexible money disappears.\\n\\n\\nThese leaders don’t need another tool. They need a backbone.\\n\\n4. Broken Options\\nExisting solutions don’t fit this stage.\\nDIY SaaS stack\\n\\n\\nCRMs, grant tools, accounting, email…\\n\\n\\nFounders don’t have time (or staff) to integrate and maintain them.\\n\\n\\nConsultants &amp;amp; agencies\\n\\n\\nProject-based, expensive, and seen as “overhead.”\\n\\n\\nAdvice without ongoing operational responsibility.\\n\\n\\nRebuilding staff\\n\\n\\nBay Area-ish:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDevelopment: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\n$360–450k/year just for the backbone on a fragile budget.\\n\\n\\nThere is no integrated, AI-native backbone designed for $400k–$1M orgs that have real relationships but no team.\\n\\n5. Director – What We Are\\nDirector is an AI-native backbone and forward-deployed team for nonprofits.\\nWe provide:\\nDirector OS – a vertical operating system for:\\n\\n\\nRevenue &amp;amp; relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; finance\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; compliance\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; funder narratives\\n\\n\\nA Director Pod – shared leadership capacity:\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops leadership\\n\\n\\nLater: dedicated development &amp;amp; ops roles as we scale\\n\\n\\nWe plug into an existing org and donor base and give them the leadership bench they can’t afford to rebuild alone.\\n\\n6. Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\nDurable funding comes from:\\n\\n\\nMajor donors\\n\\n\\nAnchor institutions\\n\\n\\nLong-term partners\\n\\n\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\n\\n\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\n\\n\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\n\\n\\nDirector’s focus:\\n\\n\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\n\\n\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\n\\n\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\n\\n\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\n\\n7. The Director Pod – Capacity Ramp (Lean First, Then Scale)\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\nYear 1 – Lean “Proto-Pod”\\nTeam:\\n\\n\\nYou (Founder/CEO)\\n\\n\\n1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n\\n\\n1 Finance Director (covering finance + ops)\\n\\n\\n1 Founding Engineer\\n\\n\\nCapacity:\\n\\n\\nFDD deeply embedded with up to 4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director builds cross-org finance/ops playbooks and workflows\\n\\n\\nEngineer builds Director OS + first agents alongside you\\n\\n\\nPhase 2 – 8 orgs\\nMature core agents take on most repetitive finance/ops/reporting tasks\\n\\n\\nSame FDD + Finance Director structure supports more orgs, with additional FDD capacity added as needed\\n\\n\\nPhase 3 – 16 orgs\\n2+ FDDs each focused on 4–6 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance/ops/development leadership scaled across all 16 using agents and standardized playbooks\\n\\n\\nAgents perform the recurring work; Pods focus on relationships and decisions.\\n\\n8. Director OS – Product Overview\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\nDirector OS brings together:\\nRevenue &amp;amp; Relationships\\n\\n\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\n\\n\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; Finance\\n\\n\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\n\\n\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance\\n\\n\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nChecklists and playbooks\\n\\n\\nNarratives &amp;amp; Reporting\\n\\n\\nBoard decks and updates\\n\\n\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\n\\n\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\n\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\nExamples:\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\n\\n\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\n\\n\\nMaintains relationship maps\\n\\n\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\n\\n\\nFinance &amp;amp; Runway Agent\\n\\n\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\n\\n\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\n\\n\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\n\\n\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\n\\n\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\n\\n\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\n\\n\\nPattern:\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\n\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDev: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\n\\n\\nWith Director:\\n\\n\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\n\\n\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\n\\n\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\n\\n\\n\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\n\\n\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\n\\n\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\n\\n\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\n\\n\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\n\\n\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\n\\n\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\n\\n12. Go-to-Market\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\nExisting relationships\\n\\n\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\n\\n\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\n\\n\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\n\\n\\nFunder collaborations\\n\\n\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\n\\n\\nSales motion:\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\n\\n\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\n\\n\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\n\\n\\n\\n13.

We help under-resourced nonprofit founders become fundable, operationally tight organizations by providing the leadership capacity they can't afford to rebuild alone.\\n\\n**Who is Director for?**\\nDirector serves nonprofit founders who are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary - leading programs, raising money, running operations, managing communications, and handling compliance. Our initial focus is on \\\"downshifted orgs\\\" - organizations that previously had $400K-$1M budgets but have had to lay off staff due to funding pressures.\\n\\n**How does Director work?**\\nDirector combines two components:\\n1. **Director OS** - A vertical operating system covering revenue &amp;amp; relationships, runway &amp;amp; finance, ops &amp;amp; compliance, and board &amp;amp; funder narratives\\n2. **Director Pod** - Shared leadership capacity including a Forward-Deployed Director (FDD), finance/ops leadership, and dedicated support roles\\n\\n**What problem does Director solve?**\\nPromising nonprofits plateau at $300-600K or quietly shut down - not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone. When funding tightens and staff are cut, all leadership responsibilities collapse back onto one person. Director provides the integrated, AI-native backbone these organizations need.\\n\\n## How Director Helps\\n\\n**What does Director OS include?**\\n- Revenue &amp;amp; Relationships: Major gifts map, warm pipeline, next-best actions\\n- Runway &amp;amp; Finance: Live cash forecasts, budget vs actuals visibility\\n- Ops &amp;amp; Compliance: Recurring task engine, checklists, playbooks\\n- Narratives &amp;amp; Reporting: Board decks, funder reports, impact one-pagers\\n\\n**What are AI Agents?**\\nDirector uses specialized AI agents that handle repetitive work while humans focus on judgment:\\n- Major Gifts Agent: Scans email, calendar, CRM; maintains relationship maps; drafts donor communications\\n- Finance &amp;amp; Runway Agent: Pulls accounting data, proposes categorizations, raises runway alerts\\n- Ops &amp;amp; Compliance Agent: Runs checklists, generates reminders, manages task lists\\n- Board &amp;amp; Reporting Agent: Assembles board decks, creates funder reports\\n\\n**What is a Director Pod?**\\nA Director Pod is a shared leadership team that serves multiple nonprofit organizations. Year 1 structure includes:\\n- Founder/CEO\\n- 1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)\\n- 1 Finance Director\\n- 1 Founding Engineer\\n\\nPods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.\\n\\n## Economics &amp;amp; Pricing\\n\\n**How much does Director cost?**\\nDirector Pod services cost approximately $80-120K/year per organization, compared to $360-450K/year for traditional backbone staffing (ED, Ops/Finance, Development, Comms roles).\\n\\n**What's the savings?**\\nOrganizations can save $100-180K/year in backbone costs while getting better coverage through AI-augmented human leadership.\\n\\n## For Foundations\\n\\n**Can foundations sponsor multiple organizations?**\\nYes! Foundations are an ideal customer segment. A single foundation can purchase Director packages for 5-10 grantees at once, providing:\\n- Measurable capacity ROI across their portfolio\\n- Backbone support that individual orgs couldn't afford alone\\n- One contract covering multiple organizations\\n\\n**How do foundation partnerships work?**\\nContact us to discuss capacity-building investments in your grantee portfolio. Director can be positioned as capacity-building that makes grantees more investable.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n**How do I learn more about Director?**\\n- Visit directorforgood.org\\n- View our pitch deck at directorforgood.org/deck\\n- Contact us at info@directorforgood.org\\n\\n**How can my organization become a Director client?**\\nWe start with a short diagnostic that maps your \\\"today vs with Director\\\" - showing what gets taken off the founder's plate. Contact us to schedule.\\n\\n## Investment\\n\\n**Is Director raising funding?**\\nYes, Director is raising $1M to fund 12+ months of lean team and product development. The goal is to prove the 4 → 8 → 16 org capacity story with real customers.\\n\\n**What will the funding support?**\\n- Hire FDD, Finance Director, Founding Engineer\\n- Onboard 2-4 initial organizations\\n- Ship v1 Director OS and core agents\\n- Prove that a 4-org pod delivers revenue and stability lift\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\n**How can I reach Director?**\\n- Website: directorforgood.org\\n- Email: info@directorforgood.org\\n- Pitch deck: directorforgood.org/deck\\n&amp;#96;;\\n\\nexport const CHATBOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = &amp;#96;You are Director's helpful AI assistant. Your job is to help visitors learn about Director, our AI-native backbone service for nonprofits, and how they can work with us.\\n\\nPERSONALITY:\\n- Be professional, knowledgeable, and helpful\\n- Keep responses concise but informative\\n- Focus on the value Director provides to nonprofit founders\\n- When appropriate, encourage visitors to view the pitch deck or get in touch\\n\\nGUIDELINES:\\n- Always provide accurate information based on the knowledge base below\\n- If you don't know something specific, say so and direct them to info@directorforgood.org\\n- For partnership discussions or investment inquiries, direct people to contact us directly\\n- Don't make up information that isn't in the knowledge base\\n- When mentioning links, use directorforgood.org paths\\n\\n${DIRECTOR_FAQ}\\n\\nIf someone asks about something not covered here, kindly let them know and suggest they email info@directorforgood.org for more information.&amp;#96;;\\n\","

Problem – Downshifted Orgs (Beachhead)\\nOur initial focus: orgs that already proved they can raise $400k–$1M.\\nThese orgs:\\n\\n\\nHave real donor and community relationships\\n\\n\\nHave a history of 7-figure budgets or close\\n\\n\\nBut in the current funding environment:\\n\\n\\nThey’ve laid off staff\\n\\n\\nThe founder is back to doing everything\\n\\n\\nMany are considering shutting down despite strong demand for their work\\n\\n\\nThis hits founders of color especially hard, as equity-era funding retrenches and flexible money disappears.\\n\\n\\nThese leaders don’t need another tool.

Fundraising Philosophy – Relationships First\\nDirector is built around major gifts and real relationships, not grant roulette.\\nDurable funding comes from:\\n\\n\\nMajor donors\\n\\n\\nAnchor institutions\\n\\n\\nLong-term partners\\n\\n\\nGrants are part of the picture, but:\\n\\n\\nThey are downstream of relationships\\n\\n\\n“Open call” grant-chasing is mostly a distraction for this segment\\n\\n\\nDirector’s focus:\\n\\n\\nMap and grow the major gifts pipeline\\n\\n\\nPrepare founders for high-stakes meetings\\n\\n\\nUse grants strategically once relationships exist\\n\\n\\nDirector is a relationship and revenue engine, not a shot-in-the-dark grant factory.\\n\\n7.

Director OS – Product Overview\\nOne pane of glass for an org’s backbone.\\nDirector OS brings together:\\nRevenue &amp;amp; Relationships\\n\\n\\nMajor gifts map and warm funder pipeline\\n\\n\\nNext-best actions for key relationships\\n\\n\\nRunway &amp;amp; Finance\\n\\n\\nLive cash forecasts and scenarios\\n\\n\\nBudget vs. actuals visibility\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance\\n\\n\\nRecurring task engine (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nChecklists and playbooks\\n\\n\\nNarratives &amp;amp; Reporting\\n\\n\\nBoard decks and updates\\n\\n\\nFunder reports and impact one-pagers\\n\\n\\nData flows in from email, calendar, finance systems, docs, and existing CRMs so the OS reflects reality, not just what someone remembered to log.\\n\\n9. AI Agents – How We 2–4x Human Capacity\\nSpecialized agents do the repetitive work; humans do the judgment.\\nExamples:\\nMajor Gifts Agent\\n\\n\\nScans email, calendar, CRM for each org\\n\\n\\nMaintains relationship maps\\n\\n\\nSuggests outreach and drafts donor emails and meeting briefs\\n\\n\\nFinance &amp;amp; Runway Agent\\n\\n\\nPulls accounting and bank data\\n\\n\\nProposes categorizations, reconciliations, cash-flow updates\\n\\n\\nRaises alerts on anomalies and runway risks\\n\\n\\nOps &amp;amp; Compliance Agent\\n\\n\\nRuns recurring checklists (payroll, filings, renewals)\\n\\n\\nGenerates drafts, reminders, and task lists\\n\\n\\nBoard &amp;amp; Reporting Agent\\n\\n\\nAssembles board decks and funder reports from live data\\n\\n\\nKeeps a “board-ready” view up to date\\n\\n\\nPattern:\\nAgents explore, compile, and draft.\\n FDDs and Directors review, edit, and decide.\\nThis is the same shift we’re seeing in engineering (Cursor/Devin-style agents) and customer ops — we’re applying it to nonprofit backbones.\\n\\n10. Economics – Why This Makes Sense\\nDirector makes a serious backbone affordable and scalable.\\nIllustrative comparison for a ~$500–700k org:\\nRebuilding the traditional backbone:\\n\\n\\nED: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nOps/Finance: ~100k\\n\\n\\nDev: ~100k\\n\\n\\nComms/Program ops: 60–100k\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $360–450k/year\\n\\n\\nWith Director:\\n\\n\\nED/founder: $100–150k\\n\\n\\nDirector Pod (Year 1 pricing for early orgs): target ~$80–120k/year\\n\\n\\nTotal backbone: $180–270k/year\\n\\n\\nAs Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs and agents automate more of the workflows:\\nPod-level gross margins expand\\n\\n\\nPer-org economics improve while keeping human leadership involvement high\\n\\n\\n\\n11. Why Now – AI Agents + Nonprofit Pressure\\nTwo timing curves are intersecting.\\nAgentic AI is production-ready.\\n\\n\\n“AI coworkers” are already shipping in engineering, finance, and customer operations.\\n\\n\\nA small human team can now manage far more complexity with agents doing most of the clicking.\\n\\n\\nNonprofits are under structural pressure.\\n\\n\\nOrgs that once had $1M+ budgets are losing staff and struggling to maintain operations and reporting.\\n\\n\\nFunders are more selective and want grantees with credible backbones and visibility.\\n\\n\\nDirector sits at this intersection:\\n an AI-native backbone delivered by a lean, forward-deployed team to orgs that cannot justify rebuilding full in-house leadership.\\n\\n12. Go-to-Market\\nWe start where we already have pull.\\nExisting relationships\\n\\n\\nFirst 2–4 orgs from founders and orgs you’re already effectively “directing.”\\n\\n\\nDownshifted $1M orgs\\n\\n\\nTarget leaders who have proved they can raise $400k–$1M but had to cut backbone staff.\\n\\n\\nFunder collaborations\\n\\n\\nPosition Director as a capacity-building line item that makes grantees more investable and easier to monitor.\\n\\n\\nSales motion:\\nShort diagnostic: map “today vs with Director” team and budget.\\n\\n\\nDemo Director OS + agents and show what gets taken off the founder’s plate.\\n\\n\\nClose annual retainers, expand the number of orgs and scope over time.\\n\\n\\n\\n13.

Team – Lean Year-1 Plan\\nSmall, high-leverage founding team with 12 months of runway.\\nFounder &amp;amp; CEO (you)\\n\\n\\nProduct vision, sales, fundraising, relationships\\n\\n\\nActs as early FDD alongside hire as needed\\n\\n\\nForward-Deployed Director (hire #1)\\n\\n\\nDeep nonprofit ops + fundraising\\n\\n\\nEmbedded across the first ~4 orgs\\n\\n\\nFinance Director (hire #2)\\n\\n\\nCovers finance + ops across the initial pod\\n\\n\\nDesigns playbooks the agents will run\\n\\n\\nFounding Engineer (hire #3)\\n\\n\\nBuilds Director OS and the first wave of agents with you\\n\\n\\nTarget raise for ~12 months runway (illustrative):\\nLean team + non-people costs → roughly $800k–$1M\\n\\n\\nEarly org retainers reduce net burn as you ramp to 4 paying customers.\\n\\n\\n\\n15.

I can see the structure. I need to:

1. In `data/deck-content.json`, reorder:
   - Founding Engineer → hire #1
   - Forward-Deployed Director → hire #2
   - Finance Director → hire #3

2. In `lib/deck-content.ts`, do the same reorder.

Let me make the changes to both files.Done. I've updated both files to reorder the hires:
1. Founding Engineer (hire #1)
2. Forward-Deployed Director (hire #2)
3. Finance Director (hire #3)

This reflects the user's decision to hire the engineer first while they act as the Forward-Deployed person themselves.</details></think>
