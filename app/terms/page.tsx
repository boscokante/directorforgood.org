              The materials on Director&apos;s website are provided on an &apos;as is&apos; basis. Director 
              makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other

              fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other 
              violation of rights. Further, Director does not warrant or make any representations concerning 
              the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or

              In no event shall Director or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without

              out of the use or inability to use the materials on Director&apos;s website, even if Director 
              or a Director authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the 
              possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied 
              warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these 
              limitations may not apply to you.
