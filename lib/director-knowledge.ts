## About Director

**What is Director?**
Director is an AI-native operating system and forward-deployed backbone for nonprofits. We help under-resourced nonprofit founders become fundable, operationally tight organizations by providing the leadership capacity they can't afford to rebuild alone.

**Who is Director for?**
Director serves nonprofit founders who are carrying 5 jobs on 1 salary - leading programs, raising money, running operations, managing communications, and handling compliance. Our initial focus is on "downshifted orgs" - organizations that previously had $400K-$1M budgets but have had to lay off staff due to funding pressures.

**How does Director work?**
Director combines two components:
1. **Director OS** - A vertical operating system covering revenue & relationships, runway & finance, ops & compliance, and board & funder narratives
2. **Director Pod** - Shared leadership capacity including a Forward-Deployed Director (FDD), finance/ops leadership, and dedicated support roles

**What problem does Director solve?**
Promising nonprofits plateau at $300-600K or quietly shut down - not for lack of impact, but for lack of backbone. When funding tightens and staff are cut, all leadership responsibilities collapse back onto one person. Director provides the integrated, AI-native backbone these organizations need.

## How Director Helps

**What does Director OS include?**
- Revenue & Relationships: Major gifts map, warm pipeline, next-best actions
- Runway & Finance: Live cash forecasts, budget vs actuals visibility
- Ops & Compliance: Recurring task engine, checklists, playbooks
- Narratives & Reporting: Board decks, funder reports, impact one-pagers

**What are AI Agents?**
Director uses specialized AI agents that handle repetitive work while humans focus on judgment:
- Major Gifts Agent: Scans email, calendar, CRM; maintains relationship maps; drafts donor communications
- Finance & Runway Agent: Pulls accounting data, proposes categorizations, raises runway alerts
- Ops & Compliance Agent: Runs checklists, generates reminders, manages task lists
- Board & Reporting Agent: Assembles board decks, creates funder reports

**What is a Director Pod?**
A Director Pod is a shared leadership team that serves multiple nonprofit organizations. Year 1 structure includes:
- Founder/CEO
- 1 Forward-Deployed Director (FDD)
- 1 Finance Director
- 1 Founding Engineer

Pods scale from 4 → 8 → 16 orgs as the OS and agents mature.

## Economics & Pricing

**How much does Director cost?**
Director Pod services cost approximately $80-120K/year per organization, compared to $360-450K/year for traditional backbone staffing (ED, Ops/Finance, Development, Comms roles).

**What's the savings?**
Organizations can save $100-180K/year in backbone costs while getting better coverage through AI-augmented human leadership.

## For Foundations

**Can foundations sponsor multiple organizations?**
Yes! Foundations are an ideal customer segment. A single foundation can purchase Director packages for 5-10 grantees at once, providing:
- Measurable capacity ROI across their portfolio
- Backbone support that individual orgs couldn't afford alone
- One contract covering multiple organizations

**How do foundation partnerships work?**
Contact us to discuss capacity-building investments in your grantee portfolio. Director can be positioned as capacity-building that makes grantees more investable.
